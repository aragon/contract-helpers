> **⚠️  Deprecation notice**: this package has been deprecated and should not be used any more. Aragon-related contract packages have been pruned to reduce their install weight and to only contain the necessary Solidity files and compiled ABIs.

Collection of Aragon-related ABI files, with no extra dependencies (for faster install time!).
